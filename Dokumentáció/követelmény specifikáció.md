# Requirement specification

## 1. Overview

Our team was tasked with creating a web-based application that allows the buyer to create scrum meetings. The buyer has tried many different applications, but it was not satisfied with them. They either lacked a certain feature, or it was over complicated and it took too long to achieve what they wanted to do. For this reason, they asked us to create a platform, designed specifically to plan and create scrum meetings, send invites to these meetings and a suite of supporting features to help with the organization.

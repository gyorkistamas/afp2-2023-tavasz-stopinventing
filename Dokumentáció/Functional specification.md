# Functional specification

## 1. Current situation

## 2. Objectives

The buyer currently uses Google calendar system to organise the meetings, and to send out invitations to these. This poses some issue, mainly that not everyone uses the Google ecosystem, and they sometimes experience bugs and problems with these invites. Also, they have no authentic way to see who accepted the invitation, or if they've seen the invitation at all. Besides of these, the meeting organizer has to find all the participant's email addresses, and type them in one by one. This takes a long time to do every day.

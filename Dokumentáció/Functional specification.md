# Functional specification

## 1. Current situation

The buyer currently uses Google calendar system to organise the meetings, and to send out invitations to these. This poses some issue, mainly that not everyone uses the Google ecosystem, and they sometimes experience bugs and problems with these invites. Also, they have no authentic way to see who accepted the invitation, or if they've seen the invitation at all. Besides of these, the meeting organizer has to find all the participant's email addresses, and type them in one by one. This takes a long time to do every day.

## 2. Objectives

The project goal is a website/web application, which is a compact team management application package for the client. The system was available in web browser and mobile web browser. During the registration, the user may decide what role to play in the team. The application is designed to be clean and simple for easy usage. The system provides an opportunity to make online scrum meetings and synchronized plan calendar with the team. In another tab, the site or submenu has a task tracker just like Trello, and progress monitoring with different circumstances. Only the team leader can add or remove team members in the application.

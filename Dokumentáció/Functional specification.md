# Functional specification

## 1. Current situation

The buyer currently uses Google calendar system to organise the meetings, and to send out invitations to these. This poses some issue, mainly that not everyone uses the Google ecosystem, and they sometimes experience bugs and problems with these invites. Also, they have no authentic way to see who accepted the invitation, or if they've seen the invitation at all. Besides of these, the meeting organizer has to find all the participant's email addresses, and type them in one by one. This takes a long time to do every day.

## 2. Objectives

## 6. Use Cases

### Administrator

 + The administrator can use all functions in the application, to check trouble-proof operation of the system. They have access to the user list, to moderate and manage them. They can send message to each users and global message to everyone, which they get at the same time.

### Scrum master

 + The Scrum master after the registration has a unique interface, where he/she creates and manages our teams/groups. They only can send messages or group messages to users, in our team/group. The project tab (work place) shares the same interface by users, but he/she has more options. The calendar can only be edited by the scrum master.

### Normal user (Worker)

 + They have the fewest options, just enough to get the job done. Users only see the teams they are in. And a more simplified interface than the other role, because of easier usage.

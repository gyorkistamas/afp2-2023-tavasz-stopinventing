# Requirement specification

## 1. Overview

Our team was tasked with creating a web-based application that allows the buyer to create scrum meetings. The buyer has tried many different applications, but it was not satisfied with them. They either lacked a certain feature, or it was over complicated and it took too long to achieve what they wanted to do. For this reason, they asked us to create a platform, designed specifically to plan and create scrum meetings, send invites to these meetings and a suite of supporting features to help with the organization.

## 2. Current situation

The buyer currently uses Google calendar system to organise the meetings, and to send out invitations to these. This poses some problem, mainly that not everyone uses the Google ecosystem, and they sometimes experience bugs and problems with these invites. Also, they have no reliable way to see who acknowledged the invite, or if they've seen the invite at all. On top of these, the meeting organizer has to find all the participant's email address, and type them in one by one. This takes a long time to do every day.
